# * The wait command in Bash pauses the execution of a script until all background jobs or a specific job (by PID or job ID) finish.
#   It returns the exit status of the waited-for process.
#   Usage:
#       wait â†’ waits for all background jobs to complete.
#       wait <PID> â†’ waits for a specific process ID to complete.
#       wait %<job_id> â†’ waits for a specific job (e.g., %1) to complete.
wait

# * For manual tracking if it gets orphaned in worst case:
# Check process in background:
# pgrep -f a.sh
# pgrep -f 'sh ./a.sh'

# Kill process via:
# pkill -f a.sh
