#   1. program exit natually on its own.

# âœ… `wait` command
# 1. The wait command in Bash pauses the execution of a script until
#      all background jobs or a specific job (by PID or job ID)
#      finish.
# 2. It returns the exit status of the waited-for process.
# 3. Usage:
#       wait â†’ waits for all background jobs to complete.
#       wait <PID> â†’ waits for a specific process ID to complete.
#       wait %<job_id> â†’ waits for a specific job (e.g., %1) to complete.
# 4. Keep the script running until previous background processes
#    before the wait command are running so you can intercept ctrl+c
#    signal to kill this script and trigger trap command to kill the
#    earlier background processes as well.
